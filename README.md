# PythonCourseLaunchX
Repository with the 10 "Katas" from python course for the LaunchX Microsoft training

- Almost all excercises were made in Jupyter notebooks, except for Kata 2, for this I've just made push to the folder where virtual enviroment was created just as evidence-
- For Kata 10 I added some screenshots of gotten mistakes as evidence.
